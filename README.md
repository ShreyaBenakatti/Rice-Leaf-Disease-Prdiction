# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Prdiction
As one of the top ten rice producing and consuming countries in the world, Bangladesh depends greatly on rice for its economy and for meeting its food demands. To ensure healthy and proper growth of the rice plants it is essential to detect any disease in time and prior to applying required treatment to the affected plants. Since manual detection of diseases costs a large amount of time and labour, it is inevitably prudent to have an automated system. This paper presents a rice leaf disease detection system using machine learning approaches. Three of the most common rice plant diseases namely leaf smut, bacterial leaf blight and brown spot diseases are detected in this work. Clear images of affected rice leaves with white background were used as the input.
